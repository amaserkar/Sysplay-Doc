ioctl() or input-output control is a versatile hardware-controlling system call.
It can be used with most driver categories, and for many different operations.
eg. reading/writing into registers, configuring a device, debugging the driver, etc.

One function achieves different operations by the use of 2 parameters
(command and command argument) and by using switchcase.
Additional parameters can be combined with the command argument into a structure,
whose pointer is passed. The return type of ioctl() is long integer.

The ioctl() function is implemented in the driver, and a function pointer from the 
struct file_operations is initialised with it. (similar to open, close, etc.)
It can then be invoked from the userspace using the system call int ioctl()
which is prototyped in <sys/ioctl.h>

One example of the uses of ioctl() is querying variables in the driver (kernelspace)
by a userspace application. This is done by implementing ioctl() as a file operation,
and then calling it in the userspace application functions.

The type definitions for the parameters command and command argument need to be
shared by the driver and application (in kernelspace and userspace respectively).
This is done by defining them in a common header file.

The command parameter of ioctl() is a number, but POSIX specifies some 
macros, defined in <linux/ioctl.h> for this purpose. These macros contain
additional information such as direction of operation, size of argument, etc.
eg. _IOR for read and _IOW for write
