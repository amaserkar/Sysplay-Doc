Hard disk is a non-volatile storage device (secondary memory).
It contains platters on which data is stored. Each platter has a read/write head.
There are several heads (platters), and each head has several tracks.
Tracks of the same track number in all heads together form a cylinder.
Each track has logical sectors, and each sector has a fixed size in bytes.

Total HDD size = (no. of heads)*(tracks/head)*(sectors/track)*(sector size)

This information can be accessed via fdisk -l command.
It also shows disk partitions.

Partitions are logical divisions of the hard disk, used for organising data.
Meta Data for the partitions is stored in the partition table.
The partition table followed by a signature is stored at the end of
the first sector of the HDD, called the Master Boot Record.

The remaining bytes of the first sector (before the partition table) contain
the disk signature, and a part of the boot code (which is loaded by the BIOS).

Partition tables are hard-coded to have a fixed no. of partitions.
An extended partition allows us to create more logical partitions within it.

Logical partitions have metadata stored in a linked-list (flexibility).
The first sector of the extended partition contains a Boot Record,
and each logical partition contains a Logical Boot Record.
The LL head is in the BR and each node is in the LBR.
Each node of the LL has a partition table entry, and a pointer to the next node.

Tampering with the HDD can affect the boot code, and render the system non-bootable.
