-- Auto Creation of Device Files

Registration of device files with major and minor numbers does not create them in /dev directory.
The kernel only populates the device class and device info in the corresponding /sys/<subdirectory>.
This information can be used by the udev daemon to automatically create and configure the device files.
(daemon: background process not under user's control)

class_create, device_create, device_destroy, and class_destroy functions are used to populate the info.
udev then creates the device files in the /dev directory.
Loops can be used for device drivers with multiple minor numbers in use.

-- Linking Device File Operations with Device Driver Functions

File operations are similar for regular files and device files (for the user).
In the kernel space, the Virtual File System decodes the file type and sends it to the appropriate channel.

For the VFS to pass device file operations to the device driver, they should be registered.
 1. Specify the operations in the structure file_operations.
 2. Initialise the character device structure cdev, with cdev_init().
 3. Register with the VFS by calling cdev_add().

The file_operations structure is defined in <linux/fs.h>, and the cdev functions in <linux/cdev.h>

The actual File Operation functions have to be defined in the device driver code.
